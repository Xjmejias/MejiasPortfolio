In designing my portfolio website, I applied several key UI/UX principles to ensure a simple, user-friendly experience. First, I used clear navigation with anchor links so users can easily jump to different sections like Skills, Achievements, and Personal Information. I followed a user-centered design approach by structuring the content based on what users would likely want to know first. The use of visual hierarchy through headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`) and sectioning helps guide the reader’s attention and improves readability.I also applied the principle of responsive design by including the viewport meta tag, making the site accessible on mobile devices. The use of a clean font from Google Fonts improves the site’s readability and aesthetic appeal. Adding a personal image adds a human touch, which aligns with the principle of emotional design to help users connect with the content.

One challenge I faced was making the content look clean and structured without advanced CSS styling. At first, the sections felt too plain and unorganized. I addressed this by breaking down information into short paragraphs and using consistent formatting to separate ideas clearly.

To improve the portfolio in the future, I plan to enhance the visual design with CSS styling, such as colors, spacing, and hover effects. I would also like to add interactivity with JavaScript, like a contact form or smooth scrolling. Lastly, I will review and fix grammar and spelling errors to present a more professional and polished portfolio.
